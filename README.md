# Stock Assistant Chatbot
Developed a sophisticated chatbot assistant leveraging the OpenAI API, which serves as a dynamic tool for users to interact with the stock market. The assistant is capable of retrieving real-time stock prices and delivering comprehensive insights about stock performance, market trends, and financial data. Users can ask for detailed information on individual stocks, market sectors, or general stock-related queries.

A standout feature of this assistant is its ability to plot and visualize stock performance. By issuing a command, users can request the chatbot to generate and display graphical representations of share prices, historical data, or trends over a specified period. The assistant is designed to handle multiple stock symbols, allowing users to track and compare different stocks with ease. Additionally, it can provide alerts for significant price changes or market events, enhancing the overall experience for users monitoring their investments.
